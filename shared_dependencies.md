Shared Dependencies:

1. Environment Variables: All the scripts will be interacting with the system's PATH environment variable. They will be adding the paths of the installed software (CUDA, Python, TensorRT, cuDNN) to the PATH variable.

2. Installation Directories: The scripts will be using the installation directories of CUDA, Python, TensorRT, and cuDNN. These directories need to be consistent across all scripts as they will be added to the system's PATH.

3. System Requirements: All scripts need to check the system requirements and compatibility with the hardware. This includes the operating system version, hardware specifications, and existing software versions.

4. Download Links: All scripts will be using the official download links provided by NVIDIA and Python. These links need to be consistent and up-to-date across all scripts.

5. Installation Instructions: All scripts will be following the official installation instructions provided by NVIDIA and Python. These instructions need to be consistent across all scripts.

6. Function Names: Functions for downloading and installing the software, checking system requirements, and updating the PATH variable will be shared across all scripts. These might include functions like `download_software()`, `install_software()`, `check_system_requirements()`, and `update_path_variable()`.

7. Error Messages: All scripts will need to handle potential errors during the installation process. The error messages need to be consistent across all scripts.

8. Version Numbers: The version numbers of the software (CUDA 11.8, Python 3.10, TensorRT 8.5 GA update 2, cuDNN compatible with CUDA 11.8 and TensorRT 8.5 GA update 2) will be shared across all scripts.
